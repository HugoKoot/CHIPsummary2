  "summary": "John's chat interactions provide no specific information regarding his diet, medication adherence, or physical activity, making it impossible to assess his diabetes management practices or progress. His communication has been extremely limited and largely irrelevant to health monitoring. The patient consistently offers brief, repetitive, and unhelpful responses about pizza preferences. Overall adherence status cannot be determined due to a complete lack of reported data or engagement in relevant health discussions. Momentum towards improving diabetes management is currently absent.",
