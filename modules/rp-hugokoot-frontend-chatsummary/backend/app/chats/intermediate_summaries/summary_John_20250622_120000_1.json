  "summary": "Based on the provided chat logs, John has not reported any specific information regarding diet, medication adherence, or physical activity. His interactions consistently involve brief greetings followed by either an immediate contradiction or very generic, non-informative inputs. There are no reported successes or struggles related to his diabetes management plan, nor any discernible trends in his health behaviors. Overall adherence status to *reporting* his progress is extremely low, indicating a complete lack of meaningful engagement with the bot. His momentum appears stalled as he repeatedly offers similar, uninformative inputs.",

      "explanation": "The patient repeatedly uses the highly vague and uninformative term 'test' across multiple chat sessions, including the most recent one (20250622_120000). This provides no specific information relevant to health behavior or compliance. Severity: High."

      "explanation": "The patient's interactions are consistently extremely brief and non-substantive. This typical interaction pattern (e.g., 20250622_120000) shows no attempt to discuss diet, medication, or activity, indicating very low engagement with the bot's intended purpose."

      "explanation": "The patient's immediate self-contradiction regarding pizza preferences within a single session (20250622_102633) suggests an intent to experiment with the bot rather than engage in a serious effort to report compliance."
